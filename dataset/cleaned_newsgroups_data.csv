mention sure get revised edition dr ivker started chronic severe sinus problem visit several ents totally floored said youll live spent several year trying everything standard nonstandard essentially cured chronic sinusitis share approach book honestly say road recovery following part one recommendation take systemic antifungal beginning treatment history antibiotic overuse proven time time practice im sure commented hardcore belief anti yeast hypothesis poster would definite thing say worked wonder almost two thousand case put mildly also would surprised would say one violating moral obligation help patient maybe doctor reading practice confronted patient symptom could due hypothetical yeast overgrowth eg fit profile proyeast people identified consider antifungal therapy avenue exhausted remember theory practice two different thing one without synergistic doctor something nonstandard yet produce noticeable symptomatic relief thousand patient shouldnt least sit take notice maybe ought trust say begin hypothesizing work instead shouldnt work im afraid lot doctor become enamored scientific correctness ignoring patient sworn help balanced dont see poster group come point use little common sense maybe empirical approach trying good systemic antifungal sporanox exhausted avenue one traditional medical establishment able help natural thing went couple doctor somewhat outside establishment result found significant relief would better traditional medical establishment set kind mechanism doctor without fear sued license pulled try experimental unproven beyond doubt therapy hisher patient finally reach point accepted therapy ineffective id like hear doctor tell well ive tried therapy approved accepted country since clearly dont work authority use experimental unproven technique seem helped others cant promise anything risk sign something saying understand experimental possibly risky nature unproven therapy ill register case state board anyway ent suggested wouldve jumped pronto instead going one doctor either altruistic reason greed practicing alternative therapy much risk himher risk meaning losing license possibly patient mechanism would keep control
