# Natural Language Processing (Exploration) - Under Development

In this project, I will go through different topics in NLP in order to learn and keep my exercises here to for later reference and review.

I will Spacy and NLTK for NLP

for small sentence processing we can use the en_core_web_sm but for leveraging the word vector I use en_core_web_lg

following are two very important links for dependency parsing:

https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features

we use Scikit-learn and experiment with different algorithms

topics:
String methods in python
NLP basics
intro the tools and methods
Semantic and sentiment analysis
VADER for the sentiment analysis
Topic Modeling
LDA
NMF
Deep Learning for NLP
LSTM and RNN
QA chat
Artifical neural network (ANN)
LSTM and GRU

NMF is faster than LDA and can deal with larger dataset

projects:
find the topic of the article using LDA
quora quetions labeling using NMF
word or next sentence prediction
a chat bot using the babi dataset from facebook
