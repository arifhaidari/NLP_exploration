In this project, I will go through different topics in NLP in order to learn and keep my exercises here to for later reference and review.

I will Spacy and NLTK for NLP

for small sentence processing we can use the en_core_web_sm but for leveraging the word vector I use en_core_web_lg

following are two very important links for dependency parsing:
